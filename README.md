<p id="description">Welcome to the Number Plate Detection project repository! This project focuses on detection of number plates from both photos and videos utilizing a custom-built model as well as a fine-tuned YOLOv8 architecture.</p>

<h2>üöÄ Demo</h2>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Custom Model: Custom-built model is designed specifically for number plate detection. It is my first approach to a problem demonstraiting what you can do with relatively straightforward architecture.
*   Fine-Tuned YOLOv8: Leveraging the powerful YOLOv8 architecture I have fine-tuned the model to further enhance its performance on number plate detection tasks.
*   Photo and Video Support: With help of YOLOV8 architecture system is capable of detecting number plates not only in static images but also in dynamic video footage making it suitable for real-time applications.
